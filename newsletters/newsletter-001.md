# DXT Weekly #1
*July 10, 2025*

Welcome to the inaugural issue of DXT Weekly, your go-to source for discovering the most innovative Desktop Extensions for AI applications. As the AI landscape rapidly evolves, a new category of tools is emerging that promises to revolutionize how we interact with our favorite AI assistants. Just as browser extensions transformed how we use the web, Desktop Extensions built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP) are now expanding what's possible with AI apps like Claude.

These aren't just simple add-ons â€“ they're powerful integrations that give your AI assistant direct access to your tools, data, and workflows. Think of them as bridges that connect your AI to the real world, enabling it to interact with your Windows system, search through your Obsidian knowledge base, scrape LinkedIn profiles, explore GitHub repositories, and even help you discover new recipes for the week ahead.

In this issue, we're showcasing five standout MCP servers that demonstrate the incredible potential of this new ecosystem. From productivity powerhouses to specialized utilities, these extensions represent the cutting edge of AI-human collaboration. Let's dive into what makes each one special and how they can transform your AI experience.

### Turn Your AI Assistant Into a GitHub Power User

*by Octocode Team*

The Octocode MCP Extension transforms your AI assistant into a comprehensive GitHub and npm research companion.

This extension provides deep integration with GitHub's search capabilities and npm's package ecosystem, letting you query code, analyze repositories, review commit histories, and investigate packages without leaving your AI workflow.

Perfect for developers conducting code reviews, researching implementation patterns, or evaluating potential dependencies.
